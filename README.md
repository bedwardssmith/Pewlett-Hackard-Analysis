Pewlett-Hackard has realized that they are facing a period where they will experience an unprecendented number of employees retiring.  Analysis has therefore been undertaken to better understand the future needs as well as what can be done now to ensure that ineligible employees are ready to take on the challenge of replacing those retiring.
